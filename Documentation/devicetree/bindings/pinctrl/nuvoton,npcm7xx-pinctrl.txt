Nuvoton NPCM7XX Pin Controllers

The NPCM7XX Pin Controller multi-function routed through
the multiplexing block, Each pin supports GPIO functionality (GPIOx)
and multiple functions that directly connect the pin to different
hardware blocks.

Required properties:
- compatible      : "nuvoton,npcm750-pinctrl" for Poleg NPCM750.

Contents of function subnode node
---------------------------------
Required subnode-properties:
- groups : An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a group.
- function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
  group.

  Valid values for group and function names can be found from looking at the
  group and function arrays in driver files:
  drivers/pinctrl/nuvoton/pinctrl-npcm7xx.c

For example, pinctrl might have subnodes like the following:
	r1err_pins: r1err_pins {
		groups = "r1err";
		function = "r1err";
	};
	r1md_pins: r1md_pins {
		groups = "r1md";
		function = "r1md";
	};
	r1_pins: r1_pins {
		groups = "r1";
		function = "r1";
	};

For a specific board, if it wants to use EMC (10/100 network),
it can add the following to its board-specific .dts file.
emc0: eth@f0825000 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&r1_pins
				 &r1err_pins
				 &r1md_pins>;
	phy-mode = "rmii";

if EMC hardware is not used the EMC pin can used for GPIO56
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&gpio56_pins>

Examples
========

pinctrl: pinctrl@0 {
	compatible = "nuvoton,npcm7xx-pinctrl";
	status = "okay";
	iox1_pins: iox1_pins {
		groups = "iox1";
		function = "iox1";
	};
	iox2_pins: iox2_pins {
		groups = "iox2";
		function = "iox2";
	};

	....

	clkreq_pins: clkreq_pins {
		groups = "clkreq";
		function = "clkreq";
	};
};
