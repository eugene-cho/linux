Nuvoton NPCM7XX 10/100 Ethernet MAC Controller (EMC)

The NPCM750x provides two identical Ethernet MAC Controllers
for WAN/LAN applications

Required properties:
- compatible      : "nuvoton,npcm750-emc" for Poleg NPCM750.
- reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts      : Contain the emc interrupts with flags for falling edge.
					first interrupt dedicated to Txirq
					second interrupt dedicated to Rxirq
- clocks          : phandle of emc reference clock.
- device_type	  : Should be "network"

Example:

emc0: eth@f0825000 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "nuvoton,npcm750-emc";
	reg = <0xf0825000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 16 4>, <0 15 4>;
	clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_EMC>;
};
