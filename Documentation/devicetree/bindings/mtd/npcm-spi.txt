* Nuvoton Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI)

Required properties:
  - compatible : "nuvoton,npcm750-spi" for NPCM750 BMC
  - #address-cells : should be 1.
  - #size-cells : should be 0.
  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
          the second contains the memory mapping address and length
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "control" and "memory"
  - clocks : phandle of SPI reference clock.

Optional properties:
  - chip-max-address-map: Chip maximum address mapping for direct use.
  			  the maximum address map size:
			  NPCM7xx - 0x8000000 (128Mb)

Example:

spi0: spi@fb000000 {
	compatible = "nuvoton,npcm750-spi";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0xfb000000 0x1000>, <0x80000000 0x10000000>;
	reg-names = "control", "memory";
	chip-max-address-map = <0x8000000>;
	clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_AHB>;
	spi-nor@0 {
			...
	};
};
